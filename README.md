# Hi! :musical_note:

*I'm Guillaume, a web developer and artist based in Brussels.*

## Some words about me 

I've been composing electronic music and visuals during several years with [Bunai Carus](https://bunaicarus.bandcamp.com/).

This project introduced me to the woderfull world of coding via Max/Msp. 

Then during the 2019/2020 I've done a training about web development to improve my knowledge, learn new languages and  start a proffessional reorientation.



## Languages/libraries/softwares I like

* JavaScript, Typescript, Ruby, HTML/CSS
* NodeJs
* React / Vue / Codemirror
* Electron
* GLSL
* Max/Msp / Ableton
