# Hi! :musical_note:

*I'm Guillaume, a web developer and artists based in Brussels.*

## Some words about me 

I've been composing electronic music and visuals during several years with [Bunai Carus](https://bunaicarus.bandcamp.com/).

This project introduced me to the woderfull world of coding via Max/Msp. 

Then during the 2019/2020 I've done a training about web development to improve my knowledge, learn new languages and  start a proffessional reorientation.



## Languages/libraries/softwares I like

* JavaScript HTML/CSS
* NodeJs
* React / Vue / Redux / Codemirror
* Typescript
* GLSL
* Scheme
* Max/Msp / PureData / Ableton



## About my projects

I'm currently making an opensource application with Tauri, VueJs 3, Codemirror and Typescript.

It's about a code editor created with the idea of being used in live coding situations for music and visuals, and in combination with the [Scheme For Max external](https://github.com/iainctduncan/scheme-for-max) made by Iain Duncan. Feel free to [take a look](https://github.com/guillaume-leo/scheme-editor)!
